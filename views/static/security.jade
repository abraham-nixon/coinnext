          | A majority of customer funds are stored in offline wallets. These are wallets that are kept offline with complete air-gap isolation. This is called "cold storage".
          | A limited amount of coins are stored in buffer wallets. These are wallets residing on our protected machine. They are used to fill the hot wallet in case this is necessary.
          | An absolute minimum of coins to maintain operational liquidity are stored in online (hot) wallets on our server.
          | All wallets are encrypted at all times. All <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase">passphrases</a> are stored in encrypted password management software on encrypted volumes.
          | No wallet passphrases are stored in any company software.
          | The wallets and paper backups of them are distributed in several geographically distributed vaults.
          | We maintain full reserves at all times, ready for immediate withdrawal on demand.
